# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Dashboard---Excel
In this project I analyzed hotel booking and cancellation trends to identify key patterns and suggest strategies to reduce cancellations. The dashboard provides insights into total bookings, cancellations, guest categories, booking trends, customer types, and yearly comparisons using interactive filters.

üìå Insights from the Dashboard:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Bookings & Cancellations:
65.5K total bookings, out of which 30.9K were canceled, indicating a high cancellation rate.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Hotel Category Analysis:
Resort Hotels received the most bookings (40.1K), but also had a significant share of cancellations.
City Hotels had fewer bookings (25.5K) but relatively lower cancellations.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Guest Category Analysis:
Couples booked the most (71%) but also had the highest cancellation rate.
Single travelers had the lowest booking percentage (17%) but a moderate cancellation rate.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Booking Trends:
Peak months for bookings:  July, august and sepetmeber  (~6K‚Äì7K bookings per month).
Cancellations remained high throughout the year, peaking in the same months as high bookings.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Country-wise Cancellations:
Highest cancellations from Portugal (PRT) and France (FRA).
Countries like ESP, GBR, and ITA had relatively lower cancellations.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Type Cancellations:
Transient customers (26.2K cancellations) accounted for the majority of cancellations.
Group and contract customers had minimal cancellations.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Yearly Booking & Cancellation Trends:
Booking increased in 2023 but dropped slightly in 2024.
Cancellation rate was highest in 2023 (61.5%) and decreased in 2024.

üìå Recommendations to Reduce Cancellations:
‚úÖ Implement a Stricter Cancellation Policy:

Introduce non-refundable or partially refundable bookings, especially for peak months.
‚úÖ Targeted Promotions for Reliable Customers:

Offer discounts or loyalty rewards for repeat guests and group bookings, as they have lower cancellation rates.
‚úÖ Country-Specific Strategies:

Higher deposit requirements for countries with high cancellations (e.g., Portugal & France).
Offer flexible date change options instead of cancellations.
‚úÖ Optimize Pricing Strategies:

Adjust pricing based on seasonal trends to reduce cancellations during peak months.
‚úÖ Personalized Customer Engagement:

Send reminders and special offers to guests before their stay to reduce last-minute cancellations.
